With Eatie’s health profile algorithm, users will be able to get personalised calorie targets according to their unique profiles. Eatie also has an extensive food database that can assist users to get a more accurate nutritional breakdown of their food intake. This would allow users to take better control of their goals and understand which nutrition they are lacking.
